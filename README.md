# ASCII_GLITCH

A real-time ASCII terminal display that simulates unstable signal reception — glitch bursts, VHS noise, sync loss, flicker and frozen frames.

Whatever you place inside the `<pre>` blocks becomes a “received signal”.

## Usage

Open **index.html** and replace the ASCII inside:

```html
<pre id="left">
YOUR ASCII ART
</pre>

<pre id="right">
MORE ASCII ART
</pre>
````

The animation automatically applies to every character.

Best results with monospaced ASCII.
